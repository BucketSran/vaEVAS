# Task: vbr1_l1_calibration_deadband_controller:tb

## Release Task Contract

- Form: `tb`
- Level: `L1`
- Category: Calibration, DEM, and Control
- Base function: Calibration deadband controller
- Domain: `voltage`
- Target artifact(s): `tb_calibration_deadband_controller.scs`
- Supplied/reference support artifact(s): `calibration_deadband_controller.va`
- Visible context: public task, interface, artifact, stimulus, and observable contract only.
- Hidden evaluator boundary: deterministic checker and EVAS/Spectre validation are external; do not generate checker logic.

## Form-Specific Requirements

- Generate only the Spectre transient testbench artifact(s); do not generate hidden checker logic.
- Instantiate the supplied/public DUT module(s), drive a public transient scenario, and save the required observables.
- The supplied DUT/support Verilog-A file(s) `calibration_deadband_controller.va` will be co-located with the generated testbench by the evaluation harness.
- Include it exactly with `ahdl_include "calibration_deadband_controller.va"` in the generated Spectre `.scs` netlist.
- Use Spectre AHDL instance syntax with the instance name first and module name last: `XNAME (node1 node2 ...) module_name`.
- Never write module-first syntax such as `module_name instance_name (...)`; that is not the release Spectre testbench syntax.

## Public DUT Interface To Instantiate

- `calibration_deadband_controller.va` declares module `calibration_deadband_controller` with positional ports: `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `out`, `metric`.

## Public Testbench And Observable Contract

Public transient setting used by the release harness:

```spectre
tran tran stop=80n maxstep=0.5n
```

The release harness expects these exact public scalar observables:

- `clk`
- `rst`
- `vin`
- `out`
- `metric`

When this form generates a testbench, use plain scalar save names for these observables; do not rely on instance-qualified or aliased save names.

Public stimulus/source nodes visible in the reference harness include:

- `clk`
- `rst`
- `vin`

## Public Spectre Testbench Scaffold

When this form generates a `.scs` testbench, use the following public skeleton shape. Fill in only the public stimulus details required by the task; do not copy or emit hidden checker logic.

```spectre
simulator lang=spectre
global 0
ahdl_include "calibration_deadband_controller.va"

XDUT (clk rst vin out metric) calibration_deadband_controller

tran tran stop=80n maxstep=0.5n
save clk rst vin out metric
```

Critical syntax rules:

- Every Verilog-A DUT/support file used by the testbench must have a literal `ahdl_include "<file>.va"` line in the `.scs` artifact.
- Spectre AHDL instances use instance-first/module-last syntax: `XNAME (node1 node2 ...) module_name`.
- Do not use module-first syntax such as `module_name instance_name (...)`.
- Keep saved names as plain scalar public observables, not instance-qualified aliases.

## Public Behavior Checks

- `trim_holds_inside_deadband`
- `trim_moves_for_large_error`
- `trim_clamped_to_range`

## Output Contract

Return exactly one source artifact named `tb_calibration_deadband_controller.scs`.
Do not include explanatory prose outside the source artifact contents.

## Task-Specific Public Description

### Calibration deadband controller (tb-generation)

Write a Spectre transient testbench for the described behavioral Verilog-A module.

Behavioral intent:

Update a bounded trim code only when the signed error is outside a deadband.

Module name: `calibration_deadband_controller`.
Domain: pure voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
Do not use current contributions, transistor-level devices, AC/noise analysis,
or KCL/KVL solving assumptions.

Public port contract:

```verilog
module calibration_deadband_controller(clk, rst, vin, out, metric);
input clk, rst, vin;
output out, metric;
electrical clk, rst, vin, out, metric;
```

Signal contract:

clk and rst are voltage-coded logic signals, low=0 V and high=0.9 V with threshold 0.45 V. vin is a signed calibration error around 0.45 V. out is a bounded trim voltage that holds inside the deadband and steps only outside it. metric is high only on an accepted trim update.

Saved waveform columns:

```text
clk rst vin out metric
```

Public transient contract:

```spectre
tran tran stop=80n maxstep=0.5n
```
