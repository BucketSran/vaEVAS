# Dynamic Comparator Kickback Metric

## Task Contract

Implement a Verilog-A DUT source package for a mixed-signal behavioral circuit block.

- Target artifacts: `dynamic_comparator_kickback_metric.va`
- Public top module: `dynamic_comparator_kickback_metric`
- Required public module: `dynamic_comparator_kickback_metric`

The submitted source must include the target artifact and public module listed above. The public top module is the top-level DUT entry point; optional helper modules may be included only when they are part of the returned DUT source package, not verification harness code.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Declare top module `dynamic_comparator_kickback_metric` with positional electrical ports `vinp, vinn, clk, rst, enable, decision, kickback_metric, valid`. All top-level ports are electrical.

The top module must expose exactly the public top-level port order above. Optional implementation-local helper modules are allowed, but no helper module is required by the public contract.

## Public Parameter Contract

Provide these overrideable public parameters on the top module and propagate compatible values to helper modules where needed:

- `vdd = 0.9 V`: logic high and upper output rail.
- `vss = 0.0 V`: logic low and lower output rail.
- `vcm = 0.45 V`: signal common-mode reference.
- `vth = 0.45 V`: threshold for voltage-coded control inputs.
- `tr = 200 ps`: output transition smoothing time.

## Required Behavior

- On reset or when disabled, clear `decision`, `kickback_metric`, and `valid`.
- On each enabled rising `clk` edge, latch the sign of `vinp - vinn` into `decision`.
- Drive `kickback_metric` as a voltage-coded function of the absolute input overdrive.
- Small overdrive must produce a larger kickback metric than large overdrive, up to the public rail limits.
- Assert `valid` after each completed decision update.
- Use only voltage-domain behavioral state and voltage contributions on public electrical outputs.
- Do not expose pass/fail flags; expose only the public observable metrics named in the interface.

The exact metric contract is `overdrive = abs(V(vinp)-V(vinn))` and `kickback_metric = clamp(vcm + 0.30/(1.0 + overdrive/0.030), vss, vdd)`.

## Modeling Constraints

Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A suitable for transient simulation. Use voltage contributions for public electrical outputs. Do not instantiate transistor-level devices. Do not add verification harnesses, simulation decks, generated result files, logs, reports, debug-only ports, or pass/fail flags.

This is a DUT circuit-block task: implement the observable behavior directly and keep any optional internal decomposition solver-owned. Keep the top-level observable behavior sufficient to validate the public contract under varied stimulus conditions.

## Output Contract

Return exactly these complete source artifacts:

- `dynamic_comparator_kickback_metric.va`
