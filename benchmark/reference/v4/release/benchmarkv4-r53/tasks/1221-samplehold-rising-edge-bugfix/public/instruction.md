# Samplehold Rising Edge Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `samplehold_rising_edge.va`:
  - Module `samplehold_rising_edge` (entry)
    - position 0: `control` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vout` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `samplehold_rising_edge.thresh` defaults to `2.5`; valid range: finite; overrides thresh.
- `samplehold_rising_edge.tdel` defaults to `20p`; valid range: finite; overrides tdel.
- `samplehold_rising_edge.tr` defaults to `20p`; valid range: finite; overrides tr.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_SAMPLE_VIN_ON_EACH_RISING_CONTROL`: restore: Sample `vin` on each rising `control` crossing of `thresh`. Required traces: `time`, `control`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_HOLD_THE_SAMPLED_VOLTAGE_ON_VOUT`: restore: Hold the sampled voltage on `vout` until the next rising control crossing. Required traces: `time`, `control`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_DO_NOT_CONTINUOUSLY_TRACK_VIN_BETWEEN`: restore: Do not continuously track `vin` between sample events. Required traces: `time`, `control`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_DRIVE_VOUT_WITH_SMOOTH_VOLTAGE_DOMAIN`: restore: Drive `vout` with smooth voltage-domain output behavior. Required traces: `time`, `control`, `vin`, `vout`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- Sample `vin` on each rising `control` crossing of `thresh`.
- Hold the sampled voltage on `vout` until the next rising control crossing.
- Do not continuously track `vin` between sample events.
- Drive `vout` with smooth voltage-domain output behavior.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `samplehold_rising_edge.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
