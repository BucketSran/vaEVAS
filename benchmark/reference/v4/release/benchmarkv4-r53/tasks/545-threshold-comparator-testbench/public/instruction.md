# Threshold Comparator Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Threshold Comparator` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `comparator.va`:
  - Module `comparator` (entry)
    - position 0: `VDD` (inout, electrical)
    - position 1: `VSS` (inout, electrical)
    - position 2: `VINP` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `VINN` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `OUT_P` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/comparator.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (VDD VSS VINP VINN OUT_P) comparator`
- Required saved public traces: `VDD`, `VSS`, `VINP`, `VINN`, `OUT_P`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `comparator.tedge` defaults to `1e-10` s; valid range: tedge > 0; sets OUT_P rail-transition smoothing.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_INITIAL_DECISION`: exercise and make observable: At initialization, OUT_P reflects the sign of VINP minus VINN. Required traces: `time`, `VINP`, `VINN`, `OUT_P`.
- `P_RISING_DIFFERENTIAL`: exercise and make observable: When VINP crosses above VINN, OUT_P transitions to the VDD rail. Required traces: `time`, `VDD`, `VINP`, `VINN`, `OUT_P`.
- `P_FALLING_DIFFERENTIAL`: exercise and make observable: When VINP crosses below VINN, OUT_P transitions to the VSS rail. Required traces: `time`, `VSS`, `VINP`, `VINN`, `OUT_P`.
- `P_BIDIRECTIONAL_RESPONSE`: exercise and make observable: Repeated differential crossings in either direction update the retained decision without requiring a clock or reset. Required traces: `time`, `VINP`, `VINN`, `OUT_P`.
- `P_RAIL_SMOOTHING`: exercise and make observable: OUT_P is rail-referenced and changes with finite transition smoothing set by tedge. Required traces: `time`, `VDD`, `VSS`, `OUT_P`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- Initialize `OUT_P` from the initial sign of `V(VINP,VSS) - V(VINN,VSS)`.
- Drive `OUT_P` high to `VDD` when `VINP` crosses above `VINN`.
- Drive `OUT_P` low to `VSS` when `VINP` crosses below `VINN`.
- Respond to both rising and falling zero-differential crossings.
- Use finite transition-style smoothing for rail-referenced output changes.


The required trace names are: `time`, `VDD`, `VSS`, `VINP`, `VINN`, `OUT_P`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
