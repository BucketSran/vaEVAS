# Smooth Absolute Value Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `absolute_value.va`:
  - Module `absolute_value` (entry)
    - position 0: `sigin` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `sigout` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `absolute_value.smooth` defaults to `0.05 from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides smooth.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_SMOOTH_ABSOLUTE_TRANSFER`: restore: Drive `sigout` as the smooth absolute-value transfer `V(sigin) * tanh(V(sigin) / smooth)`: even in input, nonnegative, deterministic, memoryless, rounded near zero, and asymptotically equal to input magnitude for large positive and negative inputs. Required traces: `time`, `sigin`, `sigout`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Drive `sigout` as the smooth absolute-value transfer `V(sigin) * tanh(V(sigin) / smooth)`. The transfer should be even in the input, nonnegative, deterministic, memoryless, and rounded near zero instead of using a sharp ideal absolute-value cusp. For large positive and negative inputs, the output should approach the corresponding input magnitude.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `absolute_value.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
