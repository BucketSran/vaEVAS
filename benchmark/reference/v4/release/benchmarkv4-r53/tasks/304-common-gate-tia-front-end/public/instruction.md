# Common-gate TIA Front-end Macro

## Task Contract

Implement a Verilog-A DUT source package for a mixed-signal behavioral circuit block.

- Target artifacts: `common_gate_tia_front_end.va`
- Public top module: `common_gate_tia_front_end`
- Required public module: `common_gate_tia_front_end`

The submitted source must include the target artifact and public module listed above. The public top module is the top-level DUT entry point; optional helper modules may be included only when they are part of the returned DUT source package, not verification harness code.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Declare top module `common_gate_tia_front_end` with positional electrical ports `vin_proxy, bias, enable, rst, vout, transimpedance_metric, overload`. All top-level ports are electrical.

The top module must expose exactly the public top-level port order above. Optional implementation-local helper modules are allowed, but no helper module is required by the public contract.

## Public Parameter Contract

Provide these overrideable public parameters on the top module and propagate compatible values to helper modules where needed:

- `vdd = 0.9 V`: logic high and upper output rail.
- `vss = 0.0 V`: logic low and lower output rail.
- `vcm = 0.45 V`: signal common-mode reference.
- `vth = 0.45 V`: threshold for voltage-coded control inputs.
- `tr = 200 ps`: output transition smoothing time.
- `rz_gain = 3.0`: voltage-domain transimpedance proxy gain.
- `bias_min = 0.3 V`: low-bias gain-reduction threshold.

## Required Behavior

- On reset or when disabled, drive `vout` to `vcm` and clear the metrics.
- Treat `vin_proxy` as a voltage-domain proxy for input current magnitude.
- Let `gain_scale = clamp((V(bias)-bias_min)/(vcm-bias_min), vss, vdd)`, then floor `gain_scale` at `0.35`; let `effective_gain = rz_gain * gain_scale`.
- Let `raw_target = vcm + effective_gain * (V(vin_proxy)-vcm)` and drive `vout = clamp(raw_target, vss, vdd)`.
- Drive `transimpedance_metric = clamp(vdd * effective_gain / rz_gain, vss, vdd)` and assert `overload = vdd` exactly when `raw_target` lies outside `[vss, vdd]`.
- Use only voltage-domain behavioral state and voltage contributions on public electrical outputs.
- Do not expose pass/fail flags; expose only the public observable metrics named in the interface.

## Modeling Constraints

Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A suitable for transient simulation. Use voltage contributions for public electrical outputs. Do not instantiate transistor-level devices. Do not add verification harnesses, simulation decks, generated result files, logs, reports, debug-only ports, or pass/fail flags.

This is a DUT circuit-block task: implement the observable behavior directly and keep any optional internal decomposition solver-owned. Keep the top-level observable behavior sufficient to validate the public contract under varied stimulus conditions.

## Output Contract

Return exactly these complete source artifacts:

- `common_gate_tia_front_end.va`
