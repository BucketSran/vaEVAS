# Divide By Two Toggle Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `divide_by_two_toggle.va`:
  - Module `divide_by_two_toggle` (entry)
    - position 0: `clkin` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `clkout` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- No public parameter is declared.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_RISING_EDGE_TOGGLE_STATE`: restore: Each rising `clkin` crossing through 0.5 V toggles the retained divider state. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `clkout`.
- `P_INITIAL_LOW_STATE`: restore: The retained state and `clkout` start low before the first input-clock edge. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `clkout`.
- `P_OUTPUT_RAIL_LEVELS`: restore: `clkout` drives 0.9 V for high state and 0.0 V for low state without amplitude scaling. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `clkout`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Initialize the internal state low. On each rising crossing of `clkin` through 0.5 V, toggle the internal state. Drive `clkout` to 0.9 V when the state is high and 0.0 V when it is low.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `divide_by_two_toggle.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
