# Converter Static Linearity Measurement Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `converter_static_linearity_measurement_flow.va`:
  - Module `converter_static_linearity_measurement_flow` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `code` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `recon` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `dnl` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `inl` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `converter_static_linearity_measurement_flow.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: finite real; sets clock and reset logic threshold.
- `converter_static_linearity_measurement_flow.vfs` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vfs > 0; sets the full-scale input and code-output range.
- `converter_static_linearity_measurement_flow.tr` defaults to `1.2e-10` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets metric-output transition smoothing.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_RESET_STATE`: restore: Active-high reset clears the retained conversion and previous-step state to the public reset values. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `code`, `recon`, `dnl`, `inl`.
- `P_FOUR_BIT_QUANTIZATION`: restore: On each non-reset rising clk edge, vin clips to 0 through vfs and quantizes monotonically to one of 16 codes represented as code_index times vfs/15. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `code`.
- `P_PUBLIC_RECONSTRUCTION_TABLE`: restore: For each code 0 through 15, recon equals the corresponding value in the public monotonic non-ideal reconstruction table, with default table voltages scaled by vfs/0.9 for legal vfs overrides. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `code`, `recon`.
- `P_INL_METRIC`: restore: INL encodes reconstruction error from the vfs/15-per-code ideal ramp using the public gain and 0.05 V through 0.85 V clamp. Required traces: `time`, `code`, `recon`, `inl`.
- `P_DNL_INCREASING_STEP`: restore: For a valid increasing code step, dnl encodes actual reconstruction-step error relative to vfs/15 per code step with the public scaling and clamp. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `code`, `recon`, `dnl`.
- `P_DNL_NO_STEP_BASELINE`: restore: Before a valid increasing step, or when code does not increase, dnl is held at the 0.45 V baseline. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `code`, `recon`, `dnl`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

This is an L2 converter measurement-flow component, not just an ideal quantizer.
On each rising crossing of `clk`, reset the retained state when `rst` is high.
Otherwise, clip `vin` to the 0-to-`vfs` range, quantize it to a 4-bit code, and
drive `code` as the code index times `vfs / 15`.

Drive `recon` from this public monotonic non-ideal reconstruction table for
codes 0 through 15. The numbers below are the default voltages for
`vfs = 0.9 V`; for any legal `vfs` override, scale each table entry by
`vfs / 0.9`.

```text
0.000, 0.055, 0.118, 0.182, 0.245, 0.303, 0.366, 0.428,
0.491, 0.553, 0.612, 0.674, 0.735, 0.798, 0.855, 0.900
```

Use the ideal 4-bit reference ramp `ideal_recon = (vfs / 15) * code_index`.
Drive `inl` as:

```text
inl = clamp(0.45 + 3.0 * (recon - ideal_recon), 0.05, 0.85)
```

For `dnl`, retain the previous valid code and reconstruction. When the current
code is greater than the previous code, compute:

```text
ideal_step = (vfs / 15) * (code_index - previous_code_index)
step_err = (recon - previous_recon) - ideal_step
dnl = clamp(0.45 + 4.0 * step_err, 0.05, 0.85)
```

When there is no previous valid increasing code step, drive `dnl = 0.45`.

**Public Verification Context**

The public transient scenario saves `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `code`, `recon`, `dnl`,
and `inl` over a converter sweep. Treat those values as the verification
scenario for observable behavior, not as DUT implementation details.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic rising-edge sampled quantization and retained previous-step state.
- Use only the public reconstruction table and smoothed voltage outputs.
- Do not hard-code validation sweeps or use current contributions, transistor-level devices, continuous-time operators, or validation side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `converter_static_linearity_measurement_flow.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
