# Enable Gated Clock Pulse Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `enable_gated_clock_pulse.va`:
  - Module `enable_gated_clock_pulse` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `en` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `pulse` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `enable_gated_clock_pulse.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vdd > 0; sets the voltage-coded high level of pulse.
- `enable_gated_clock_pulse.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: 0 < vth < vdd; sets the logic decision threshold for clk and en.
- `enable_gated_clock_pulse.tr` defaults to `2e-11` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets the rise and fall smoothing time of pulse.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_ENABLED_HIGH`: restore: pulse approaches vdd whenever both clk and en are above vth. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.
- `P_DISABLED_LOW`: restore: pulse approaches 0 V whenever either clk or en is below vth. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.
- `P_ENABLE_GATING`: restore: Changing en gates the observed clock level without creating a high output while clk is logically low. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.
- `P_OUTPUT_LEVELS`: restore: pulse uses voltage-coded 0 V and vdd levels with finite transition smoothing set by tr. Required traces: `time`, `pulse`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- Treat `clk` and `en` as voltage-coded logic using `vth`.
- Drive `pulse` high exactly when both `clk` and `en` are high.
- Drive `pulse` low otherwise.


## Modeling Constraints

- AMS role: enable-qualified clock/control pulse gate for sampled-data timing.
- Use deterministic pure voltage-domain behavior.
- Derive logic decisions from vth and the output high level from vdd.
- Do not add undeclared state, ports, artifacts, or validation-only behavior.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `enable_gated_clock_pulse.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
