# Two Channel Sample Demux Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `two_channel_sample_demux.va`:
  - Module `two_channel_sample_demux` (entry)
    - position 0: `samp1` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `samp2` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `clks1` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `clks2` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `vout` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `two_channel_sample_demux.vth` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vth.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_CLOCKED_CHANNEL_SELECTION`: restore: A rising `clks1` crossing samples `samp1` and a rising `clks2` crossing samples `samp2` into the shared held output. Required traces: `time`, `clks1`, `clks2`, `samp1`, `samp2`, `vout`.
- `P_BOTH_CHANNELS_REACHABLE`: restore: Both clocked sample channels can independently update `vout` without one channel masking the other. Required traces: `time`, `clks1`, `clks2`, `samp1`, `samp2`, `vout`.
- `P_OUTPUT_GAIN_AND_HOLD`: restore: `vout` holds the selected sample amplitude without gain scaling between clock events. Required traces: `time`, `clks1`, `clks2`, `samp1`, `samp2`, `vout`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

On a rising crossing of `clks1` through `vth`, sample `samp1` into the output register. On a rising crossing of `clks2` through `vth`, sample `samp2` into the output register. Hold the most recently sampled value on `vout` between events.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `two_channel_sample_demux.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
