# Soft Voltage Clamp Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Soft Voltage Clamp` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `soft_voltage_clamp_behavior.va`:
  - Module `soft_voltage_clamp_behavior` (entry)
    - position 0: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vout` (output, electrical)
    - position 2: `vgnd` (input, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/soft_voltage_clamp_behavior.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (vin vout 0) soft_voltage_clamp_behavior`
- Required saved public traces: `vin`, `vout`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- No public parameter is declared.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_REFERENCED_INPUT_OUTPUT`: exercise and make observable: Use `V(vin, vgnd)` as input and drive `V(vout, vgnd)` as output. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_LINEAR_MIDDLE_REGION`: exercise and make observable: Pass the input linearly for `0.0 V <= V(vin, vgnd) <= 0.4 V`. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_SOFT_LOWER_LIMIT`: exercise and make observable: Below 0.0 V, apply an exponential soft lower limit that approaches -0.2 V with a 0.2 V softness span. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_SOFT_UPPER_LIMIT`: exercise and make observable: Above 0.4 V, apply an exponential soft upper limit that approaches 0.6 V with a 0.2 V softness span. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Use `V(vin, vgnd)` as the input. Pass the input through linearly from 0.0 V to 0.4 V, including the knee points. Below 0.0 V, apply an exponential soft lower limit that approaches -0.2 V. Above 0.4 V, apply an exponential soft upper limit that approaches 0.6 V. Use a 0.2 V softness span on both sides.


The required trace names are: `time`, `vin`, `vout`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
