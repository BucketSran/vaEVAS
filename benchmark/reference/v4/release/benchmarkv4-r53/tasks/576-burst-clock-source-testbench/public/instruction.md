# Burst Clock Source Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Burst Clock Source` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `clk_burst_gen.va`:
  - Module `clk_burst_gen` (entry)
    - position 0: `CLK` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `RST_N` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `CLK_OUT` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/clk_burst_gen.va`
- DUT instance: `IDUT (CLK RST_N CLK_OUT) clk_burst_gen div=8 vdd=0.9 vth=0.45`
- Required saved public traces: `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `clk_burst_gen.div` defaults to `8` input-clock cycles; valid range: div >= 3; sets the number of input-clock cycles in each repeating burst frame.
- `clk_burst_gen.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vdd > 0; sets the voltage-coded CLK_OUT high level.
- `clk_burst_gen.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: 0 < vth < vdd; sets the CLK and active-low reset decision threshold.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_ACTIVE_LOW_RESET`: exercise and make observable: While RST_N is below vth, CLK_OUT is low and the burst frame counter is restarted. Required traces: `time`, `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`.
- `P_FRAME_START`: exercise and make observable: After reset release, rising CLK crossings advance a repeating frame of div input-clock cycles beginning at position 0. Required traces: `time`, `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`.
- `P_TWO_CYCLE_BURST`: exercise and make observable: At frame positions 0 and 1, CLK_OUT passes the voltage-coded CLK waveform, including its high and low phases. Required traces: `time`, `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`.
- `P_QUIET_REMAINDER`: exercise and make observable: At frame positions 2 through div minus 1, CLK_OUT remains low regardless of CLK level. Required traces: `time`, `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`.
- `P_FRAME_REPEAT`: exercise and make observable: The two-cycle burst followed by the quiet remainder repeats every div rising CLK crossings. Required traces: `time`, `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`.
- `P_OUTPUT_LEVELS`: exercise and make observable: CLK_OUT uses 0 V and vdd as its voltage-coded low and high levels. Required traces: `time`, `CLK_OUT`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

`RST_N` is an active-low reset. While reset is asserted, restart the burst
cycle counter and drive `CLK_OUT` low. After reset is released, detect rising
crossings of `CLK` through `vth`. In each `div`-cycle frame, pass the input
clock waveform to `CLK_OUT` for frame positions 0 and 1, then hold `CLK_OUT`
low for the remaining frame positions. Repeat this frame pattern indefinitely.

Use voltage-domain event logic such as `@(cross(...,+1))`/`@(cross(...,-1))`
and drive the output with `transition(...)`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `CLK`, `RST_N`, `CLK_OUT`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
