# Differential Common Mode Window Monitor Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Differential Common Mode Window Monitor` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.va`:
  - Module `differential_common_mode_window_monitor` (entry)
    - position 0: `vip` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vcm_ref` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `en` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `diff_ok` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `cm_ok` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `valid` (output, electrical)
    - position 7: `diff_metric` (output, electrical)
    - position 8: `cm_metric` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/differential_common_mode_window_monitor.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (vip vin vcm_ref en diff_ok cm_ok valid diff_metric cm_metric) differential_common_mode_window_monitor`
- Required saved public traces: `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.vth` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vth.
- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.vhi` defaults to `0.9`; valid range: finite; overrides vhi.
- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.diff_max` defaults to `0.30`; valid range: finite; overrides diff_max.
- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.diff_fullscale` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides diff_fullscale.
- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.cm_tol` defaults to `0.080`; valid range: finite; overrides cm_tol.
- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.cm_fullscale` defaults to `0.160`; valid range: finite; overrides cm_fullscale.
- `differential_common_mode_window_monitor.tr` defaults to `50p`; valid range: finite; overrides tr.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_CONTINUOUSLY_COMPUTE_VDIFF_V_VIP_V`: exercise and make observable: Continuously compute `vdiff = V(vip) - V(vin)` and `vcm = 0.5 * (V(vip) + V(vin))`. Drive `diff_ok` high only while `en` is high and `abs(vdiff)` is no larger than `diff_max`. Drive `cm_ok` high only while `en` is high and `abs(vcm - V(vcm_ref))` is no larger than `cm_tol`. Drive `valid` high only when both `diff_ok` and `cm_ok` would be high. Drive `diff_metric` as `vhi * clip(abs(vdiff) / diff_fullscale, 0, 1)` and `cm_metric` as `vhi * clip(abs(vcm - V(vcm_ref)) / cm_fullscale, 0, 1)`. Smooth the voltage-coded Boolean outputs with `transition()`. Required traces: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.
- `P_BUILD_A_VOLTAGE_DOMAIN_INPUT_VALIDITY`: exercise and make observable: Build a voltage-domain input-validity monitor for a differential analog front-end. The module checks whether the differential input magnitude remains inside a public linear range, whether the instantaneous common-mode level stays near a reference, and whether the enabled input pair is valid for downstream behavioral processing. Required traces: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.
- `P_VTH_0_45_V_LOGIC_THRESHOLD`: exercise and make observable: `vth = 0.45 V`: logic threshold for `en`. Required traces: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.
- `P_VHI_0_9_V_HIGH_LEVEL`: exercise and make observable: `vhi = 0.9 V`: high level for voltage-coded outputs. Required traces: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.
- `P_DIFF_MAX_0_30_V_MAXIMUM`: exercise and make observable: `diff_max = 0.30 V`: maximum allowed `abs(V(vip) - V(vin))`. Required traces: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.
- `P_DIFF_FULLSCALE_0_45_V_FULL`: exercise and make observable: `diff_fullscale = 0.45 V`: full-scale value for `diff_metric`. Required traces: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Continuously compute `vdiff = V(vip) - V(vin)` and
`vcm = 0.5 * (V(vip) + V(vin))`. Drive `diff_ok` high only while `en` is high
and `abs(vdiff)` is no larger than `diff_max`. Drive `cm_ok` high only while
`en` is high and `abs(vcm - V(vcm_ref))` is no larger than `cm_tol`. Drive
`valid` high only when both `diff_ok` and `cm_ok` would be high. Drive
`diff_metric` as `vhi * clip(abs(vdiff) / diff_fullscale, 0, 1)` and
`cm_metric` as `vhi * clip(abs(vcm - V(vcm_ref)) / cm_fullscale, 0, 1)`.
Smooth the voltage-coded Boolean outputs with `transition()`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `cm_metric`, `cm_ok`, `diff_metric`, `diff_ok`, `en`, `valid`, `vcm_ref`, `vin`, `vip`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
