# Bias Voltage Generator With Enable Trim Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `bias_voltage_generator_with_enable_trim.va`:
  - Module `bias_voltage_generator_with_enable_trim` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `out` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `metric` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `bias_voltage_generator_with_enable_trim.tr` defaults to `1e-10` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets rise and fall smoothing for out and metric.
- `bias_voltage_generator_with_enable_trim.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: vth > 0; sets the decision threshold for clk and rst.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_CLOCKED_UPDATE`: restore: Bias state changes are evaluated on rising clk crossings through vth and hold between clock updates. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_DISABLE_RESET`: restore: At an update, rst above vth or vin below 0.25 V disables the generator, returning out and metric to 0 V. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_TRIM_TARGET`: restore: When enabled, the target is 0.28 V plus 0.55 times (vin minus 0.25 V) divided by 0.65 V, clamped to 0.28 V through 0.82 V. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `vin`, `out`.
- `P_SETTLING`: restore: At each enabled update, out advances by 45 percent of the remaining difference to the current target rather than jumping directly. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `vin`, `out`.
- `P_MONOTONIC_TRIM`: restore: For otherwise equal enabled histories, a higher trim request produces a target and settled out value no lower than a smaller request. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `vin`, `out`.
- `P_ENABLE_METRIC`: restore: metric approaches 0.9 V while enabled and 0 V while disabled, with transition smoothing set by tr. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `metric`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- `clk` and `rst` are voltage-coded logic signals, low near 0 V and high near 0.9 V.
- Treat `vin` as a combined enable/trim request voltage.
- Update the bias state on rising `clk` crossings through `vth`.
- A high `rst` or `vin < 0.25 V` disables the bias generator: reset `out` to 0 V and drive `metric` to 0 V.
- When enabled, compute the bias target as `0.28 + 0.55 * ((vin - 0.25) / 0.65)` and clamp it to `[0.28 V, 0.82 V]`.
- On each enabled clock update, move the output state toward the target with `out_next = out_prev + 0.45 * (target - out_prev)` instead of jumping directly to the target.
- Higher trim/control voltage should increase `out` monotonically.
- Drive `metric` to 0.9 V while the bias generator is enabled and to 0 V while disabled.
- Keep the model pure voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A. Do not use branch-current contributions, transistor-level devices, AC/noise analysis, or KCL/KVL regulation loops.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic rising-edge voltage-domain state updates.
- Clamp the public target before applying the declared settling step.
- Do not introduce current-domain regulation, undeclared rails, or validation-only state.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `bias_voltage_generator_with_enable_trim.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
