# Rail Ramp Rate Startup Monitor Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Rail Ramp Rate Startup Monitor` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `rail_ramp_rate_startup_monitor.va`:
  - Module `rail_ramp_rate_startup_monitor` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vdd` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vss` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `en` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `rail_ok` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `ramp_ok` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `startup_ready` (output, electrical)
    - position 7: `slew_metric` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/rail_ramp_rate_startup_monitor.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (clk vdd vss en rail_ok ramp_ok startup_ready slew_metric) rail_ramp_rate_startup_monitor`
- Required saved public traces: `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_RAIL_OK_ENFORCES_ENABLE_AND_SUPPLY_WINDOW`: exercise and make observable: Drive rail_ok high only while enabled and the sampled local supply lies inside the public operating window. Required traces: `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `time`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_RAMP_OK_QUALIFIES_STARTUP_AND_SETTLING_SLEW`: exercise and make observable: Before vready, accept only positive sampled movement within dv_min..dv_max; at or above vready, accept only absolute movement no larger than dv_settle_max. Required traces: `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `time`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_STARTUP_READY_REQUIRES_CONSECUTIVE_SETTLED_SAMPLES`: exercise and make observable: Assert startup_ready only after ready_cycles consecutive samples satisfy rail, ramp, and vready qualification; clear the count on any invalid sample. Required traces: `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `time`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_SLEW_METRIC_REPORTS_BOUNDED_DELTA`: exercise and make observable: Drive slew_metric as vhi times the sampled absolute rail delta divided by dv_max, clipped to zero through one. Required traces: `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `time`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_ON_EACH_RISING_CROSSING_OF_CLK`: exercise and make observable: On each rising crossing of `clk`, sample `V(vdd, vss)` and compute the sampled change from the previous clock update. Drive `rail_ok` high only while `en` is high and the sampled local supply is inside the public operating window. Before the sampled rail reaches `vready`, drive `ramp_ok` high only when the sampled positive rail movement is between `dv_min` and `dv_max`. Once the sampled rail is at or above `vready`, drive `ramp_ok` high only when the absolute sampled movement is no larger than `dv_settle_max`. Accumulate consecutive settled samples only when `rail_ok` is high, `ramp_ok` is high, and the rail is at or above `vready`; clear that accumulator on any sampled invalid condition. Assert `startup_ready` only after `ready_cycles` consecutive settled updates. Drive `slew_metric` as `vhi * clip(abs(delta_v) / dv_max, 0, 1)`. Smooth the voltage-coded outputs with `transition()`. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_BUILD_A_VOLTAGE_DOMAIN_STARTUP_MONITOR`: exercise and make observable: Build a voltage-domain startup monitor for a locally supplied analog block. The module samples the local rail on a clock, checks whether the rail is inside the allowed operating window, qualifies the startup ramp rate, and releases a startup-ready flag only after the rail has settled for consecutive sampled updates. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_VTH_0_45_V_LOGIC_THRESHOLD`: exercise and make observable: `vth = 0.45 V`: logic threshold for `clk` and `en`. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_VHI_0_9_V_HIGH_LEVEL`: exercise and make observable: `vhi = 0.9 V`: high level for voltage-coded outputs. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_VDD_MIN_0_72_V_VDD`: exercise and make observable: `vdd_min = 0.72 V`, `vdd_max = 1.08 V`: valid `V(vdd, vss)` operating Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_VREADY_0_86_V_SAMPLED_RAIL`: exercise and make observable: `vready = 0.86 V`: sampled rail level above which settling qualification is Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

On each rising crossing of `clk`, sample `V(vdd, vss)` and compute the sampled
change from the previous clock update. Drive `rail_ok` high only while `en` is
high and the sampled local supply is inside the public operating window. Before
the sampled rail reaches `vready`, drive `ramp_ok` high only when the sampled
positive rail movement is between `dv_min` and `dv_max`. Once the sampled rail
is at or above `vready`, drive `ramp_ok` high only when the absolute sampled
movement is no larger than `dv_settle_max`. Accumulate consecutive settled
samples only when `rail_ok` is high, `ramp_ok` is high, and the rail is at or
above `vready`; clear that accumulator on any sampled invalid condition. Assert
`startup_ready` only after `ready_cycles` consecutive settled updates. Drive
`slew_metric` as `vhi * clip(abs(delta_v) / dv_max, 0, 1)`. Smooth the
voltage-coded outputs with `transition()`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `rail_ok`, `ramp_ok`, `slew_metric`, `startup_ready`, `vdd`, `vss`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
