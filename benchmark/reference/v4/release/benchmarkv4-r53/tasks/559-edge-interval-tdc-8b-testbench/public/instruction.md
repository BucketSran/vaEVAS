# Edge Interval TDC 8b Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Edge Interval TDC 8b` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `edge_interval_tdc_8b.va`:
  - Module `edge_interval_tdc_8b` (entry)
    - position 0: `start` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `stop` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `valid` (output, electrical)
    - position 3: `code0` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `code1` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `code2` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `code3` (output, electrical)
    - position 7: `code4` (output, electrical)
    - position 8: `code5` (output, electrical)
    - position 9: `code6` (output, electrical)
    - position 10: `code7` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/edge_interval_tdc_8b.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (start stop valid code0 code1 code2 code3 code4 code5 code6 code7) edge_interval_tdc_8b`
- Required saved public traces: `start`, `stop`, `valid`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `edge_interval_tdc_8b.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vdd > 0; sets the voltage-coded code and valid high level.
- `edge_interval_tdc_8b.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: 0 < vth < vdd; sets the start and stop rising-edge threshold.
- `edge_interval_tdc_8b.tr` defaults to `2e-11` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets output transition smoothing.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_START_ARMS`: exercise and make observable: Each rising start crossing begins a new interval measurement, records that edge time, and clears valid. Required traces: `time`, `start`, `stop`, `valid`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`.
- `P_NEXT_STOP_COMPLETES`: exercise and make observable: The first rising stop crossing after an armed start completes that measurement; stop crossings while unarmed do not change the result. Required traces: `time`, `start`, `stop`, `valid`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`.
- `P_INTERVAL_QUANTIZATION`: exercise and make observable: A completed interval is rounded to the nearest whole nanosecond and reported as an unsigned code. Required traces: `time`, `start`, `stop`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`.
- `P_CODE_SATURATION`: exercise and make observable: Measured interval codes are saturated to the inclusive 8-bit range 0 through 255. Required traces: `time`, `start`, `stop`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`.
- `P_VALID_AND_BIT_ORDER`: exercise and make observable: valid asserts after completion; code0 is the least significant bit and code7 is the most significant bit, using 0 V and vdd logic levels. Required traces: `time`, `valid`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- On each rising `start` crossing, arm a new measurement, store the start time, and clear `valid`.
- On the next rising `stop` crossing after an armed start, compute `round((stop_time - start_time) / 1 ns)`.
- Saturate the code to the inclusive range 0 to 255.
- Drive `code0` as the least significant bit through `code7` as the most significant bit, and assert `valid` after a completed measurement.
- Ignore unarmed `stop` edges.


The required trace names are: `time`, `start`, `stop`, `valid`, `code0`, `code1`, `code2`, `code3`, `code4`, `code5`, `code6`, `code7`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
