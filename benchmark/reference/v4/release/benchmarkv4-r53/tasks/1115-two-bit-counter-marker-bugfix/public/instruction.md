# Two Bit Counter Marker Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `two_bit_counter_marker.va`:
  - Module `two_bit_counter_marker` (entry)
    - position 0: `CLKIN` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `MC` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- No public parameter is declared.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_INITIAL_LOW`: restore: The timing/readout marker output initializes at 0.0 V before any counted edge. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `mc`.
- `P_RISING_EDGE_COUNT`: restore: Only rising crossings of CLKIN through 0.5 V advance the internal modulo-four sequence. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `mc`.
- `P_WRAP_MARKER`: restore: MC is driven to the 1.0 V marker level on the counted edge that wraps the sequence from count 3 to count 0. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `mc`.
- `P_NONWRAP_LOW`: restore: MC is driven to 0.0 V on each of the other three counted edges in every four-edge cycle. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `mc`.
- `P_PERIOD_FOUR`: restore: For a continuing valid clock, marker assertions repeat once per four rising threshold crossings. Required traces: `time`, `clkin`, `mc`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Implement a modulo-four edge counter marker for timing/readout sequencing.
Initialize the internal counter and `MC` low. On each rising crossing of
`CLKIN` through 0.5 V, increment the counter modulo four. Drive `MC` high as a
1.0 V voltage-coded marker only on the edge that wraps the count from 3 back to
0; keep it at 0.0 V on the other counted edges.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic event-driven voltage-domain state updates.
- Use 0.5 V as the fixed public rising-edge threshold and 0.0 V/1.0 V as the marker output levels for AMS timing/readout sequencing.
- Do not count falling crossings, expose undeclared count state, or add validation-only hooks.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `two_bit_counter_marker.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
