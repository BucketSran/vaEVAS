# Programmable Stimulus Sequencer Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `programmable_stimulus_sequencer.va`:
  - Module `programmable_stimulus_sequencer` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `mode` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `gate` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `out` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `metric` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `programmable_stimulus_sequencer.tr` defaults to `8e-11` s; valid range: finite real; use tr >= 0 for physical transition smoothing; sets rise and fall smoothing for out and metric without changing segment selection.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_RESET_IDLE`: restore: When rst is above the 0.45 V control threshold, out is held near 0.45 V and metric is low. Required traces: `time`, `rst`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_RAMP_MODE`: restore: For mode below 0.30 V outside reset, out produces a monotonic ramp segment from about 0.18 V toward 0.45 V and metric is near 0.20 V. Required traces: `time`, `rst`, `mode`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_CHIRP_MODE`: restore: For mode from 0.30 V through below 0.60 V, out is a sine segment centered near 0.45 V whose instantaneous frequency increases over the segment, with metric near 0.50 V. Required traces: `time`, `rst`, `mode`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_BURST_GATE`: restore: For mode at or above 0.60 V and gate high, out produces a deterministic PRBS-like burst between the low and high stimulus levels. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `mode`, `gate`, `out`.
- `P_BURST_IDLE`: restore: In burst mode with gate low, out returns near 0.45 V and metric reports the idle rather than active-burst status. Required traces: `time`, `rst`, `mode`, `gate`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_CONTROL_DRIVEN_SELECTION`: restore: Mode and gate behavior follows the voltage-coded inputs over arbitrary legal control schedules rather than a fixed stimulus timeline. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `mode`, `gate`, `out`, `metric`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Use low level near 0 V, high level near 0.9 V, and a 0.45 V decision threshold
for voltage-coded control signals. When reset is high, drive `out` near 0.45 V
and `metric` low. Otherwise:

- ramp mode, selected when `mode < 0.30 V`, drives a monotonic ramp segment
  from roughly 0.18 V toward 0.45 V and marks `metric` near 0.20 V;
- chirp mode, selected when `0.30 V <= mode < 0.60 V`, drives a sine segment
  centered near 0.45 V whose instantaneous frequency increases over the segment
  and marks `metric` near 0.50 V;
- burst mode, selected when `mode >= 0.60 V`, drives a gated PRBS-like burst
  between low and high stimulus levels while `gate` is high, returns `out` near
  0.45 V while `gate` is low, and marks `metric` near the burst or idle status.

The visible transient deck is a public verification scenario. Additional
validation may use different control schedules, so derive mode and gating
decisions from the voltage-coded inputs rather than from a particular stimulus
file.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-coded ramp, chirp, and gated burst generation.
- Use smoothed voltage contributions only; absolute transient time may shape public stimulus segments.
- Do not use current contributions, ddt(), idt(), transistor-level devices, waveform tables, validation hooks, or simulator-specific side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `programmable_stimulus_sequencer.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
