# Programmable Divider By N Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `programmable_divider_by_n.va`:
  - Module `programmable_divider_by_n` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `divctrl` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `out` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `programmable_divider_by_n.vth` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vth.
- `programmable_divider_by_n.vh` defaults to `0.9`; valid range: finite; overrides vh.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_DIVIDE_RATIO_EDGE_COUNTING`: restore: On rising crossings of `clk` through `vth`, round `divctrl` to the requested divide ratio, clip ratios below one to one, maintain the modulo counter, and assert `out` only when the counter state is zero. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `divctrl`, `out`.
- `P_CLOCK_THRESHOLD_OBSERVABILITY`: restore: Use the public `vth` threshold for edge detection so the declared clock stimulus produces the expected counted edges. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `divctrl`, `out`.
- `P_OUTPUT_HIGH_LEVEL`: restore: Drive high output states near the public `vh` level and low states near `0 V`. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `divctrl`, `out`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Detect rising crossings of `clk` through `vth`. At each qualifying edge, interpret `divctrl` as the requested divide ratio by rounding it to the nearest integer; clip ratios below one to one. Maintain an internal modulo counter for the current ratio and drive `out` high only when the counter state is zero, low otherwise. For a requested ratio of three, the output is high once every three input clock edges.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `programmable_divider_by_n.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
