# Reset Release Sequencer Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Reset Release Sequencer` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `reset_release_sequencer.va`:
  - Module `reset_release_sequencer` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `supply_ok` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `bias_ok` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `stage1` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `stage2` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `ready` (output, electrical)
    - position 7: `progress` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/reset_release_sequencer.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (clk rst supply_ok bias_ok stage1 stage2 ready progress) reset_release_sequencer`
- Required saved public traces: `bias_ok`, `clk`, `progress`, `ready`, `rst`, `stage1`, `stage2`, `supply_ok`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `reset_release_sequencer.vth` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vth.
- `reset_release_sequencer.vhi` defaults to `0.9`; valid range: finite; overrides vhi.
- `reset_release_sequencer.final_stage` defaults to `3`; valid range: finite; overrides final_stage.
- `reset_release_sequencer.tr` defaults to `60p`; valid range: finite; overrides tr.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_INITIALIZE_THE_INTERNAL_STAGE_COUNT_AND`: exercise and make observable: Initialize the internal stage count and all observables to zero. On each rising clock crossing, clear the stage count when `rst` is high, `supply_ok <= vth`, or `bias_ok <= vth`. Otherwise increment the stage count by one until it reaches `final_stage`. Required traces: `time`, `bias_ok`, `clk`, `progress`, `ready`, `rst`, `stage1`, `stage2`, `supply_ok`.
- `P_AFTER_UPDATING_THE_STAGE_COUNT_DRIVE`: exercise and make observable: After updating the stage count, drive `stage1 = vhi` when `stage_count >= 1`, `stage2 = vhi` when `stage_count >= 2`, and `ready = vhi` when `stage_count >= final_stage`; otherwise drive each of those observables to `0 V`. Drive `progress = vhi * clip01(stage_count / final_stage)`. Hold the last observable values between rising clock crossings. Required traces: `time`, `bias_ok`, `clk`, `progress`, `ready`, `rst`, `stage1`, `stage2`, `supply_ok`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- `P_INITIALIZE_THE_INTERNAL_STAGE_COUNT_AND`: Initialize the internal stage count and all observables to zero. On each rising clock crossing, clear the stage count when `rst` is high, `supply_ok <= vth`, or `bias_ok <= vth`. Otherwise increment the stage count by one until it reaches `final_stage`.
- `P_AFTER_UPDATING_THE_STAGE_COUNT_DRIVE`: After updating the stage count, drive `stage1 = vhi` when `stage_count >= 1`, `stage2 = vhi` when `stage_count >= 2`, and `ready = vhi` when `stage_count >= final_stage`; otherwise drive each of those observables to `0 V`. Drive `progress = vhi * clip01(stage_count / final_stage)`. Hold the last observable values between rising clock crossings.

The evaluator saves and may inspect these public trace signals: `time`, `bias_ok`, `clk`, `progress`, `ready`, `rst`, `stage1`, `stage2`, `supply_ok`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `bias_ok`, `clk`, `progress`, `ready`, `rst`, `stage1`, `stage2`, `supply_ok`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
