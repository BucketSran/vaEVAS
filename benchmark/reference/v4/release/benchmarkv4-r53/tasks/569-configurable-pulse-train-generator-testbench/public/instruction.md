# Configurable Pulse Train Generator Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Configurable Pulse Train Generator` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `configurable_pulse_train.va`:
  - Module `configurable_pulse_train` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `start` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `period0` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `period1` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `period2` (input, electrical)
    - position 5: `period3` (input, electrical)
    - position 6: `width0` (input, electrical)
    - position 7: `width1` (input, electrical)
    - position 8: `width2` (input, electrical)
    - position 9: `width3` (input, electrical)
    - position 10: `count0` (input, electrical)
    - position 11: `count1` (input, electrical)
    - position 12: `count2` (input, electrical)
    - position 13: `count3` (input, electrical)
    - position 14: `pulse` (output, electrical)
    - position 15: `done` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/configurable_pulse_train.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (clk start period0 period1 period2 period3 width0 width1 width2 width3 count0 count1 count2 count3 pulse done) configurable_pulse_train`
- Required saved public traces: `clk`, `start`, `period0`, `period1`, `period2`, `period3`, `width0`, `width1`, `width2`, `width3`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `pulse`, `done`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `configurable_pulse_train.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vdd > 0; sets pulse and done high levels.
- `configurable_pulse_train.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: 0 < vth < vdd; sets the threshold for clk, start, and every control-word bit.
- `configurable_pulse_train.tr` defaults to `2e-11` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets rise and fall smoothing for pulse and done.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_IDLE_CAPTURE`: exercise and make observable: A sampled high start while idle captures unsigned period3:period0, width3:width0, and count3:count0 on a rising clk crossing. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `start`, `period0`, `period1`, `period2`, `period3`, `width0`, `width1`, `width2`, `width3`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `pulse`, `done`.
- `P_ZERO_CODE_MINIMUM`: exercise and make observable: A zero-coded period, width, or count is interpreted as one clock sample rather than zero. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `period0`, `period1`, `period2`, `period3`, `width0`, `width1`, `width2`, `width3`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `pulse`, `done`.
- `P_PULSE_COUNT`: exercise and make observable: Each accepted command emits exactly the captured count number of pulses. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `start`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `pulse`, `done`.
- `P_WIDTH_AND_PERIOD`: exercise and make observable: Each pulse remains high for the captured width in clock samples and pulse starts are separated by the captured period in clock samples. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `period0`, `period1`, `period2`, `period3`, `width0`, `width1`, `width2`, `width3`, `pulse`.
- `P_COMPLETION`: exercise and make observable: After the final pulse completes, pulse is low and done is asserted. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `pulse`, `done`.
- `P_OUTPUT_LEVELS`: exercise and make observable: pulse and done use 0 V and vdd levels with finite transition smoothing set by tr. Required traces: `time`, `pulse`, `done`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- Sample controls on rising `clk` crossings.
- While idle, a sampled high `start` captures unsigned 4-bit `period`, `width`, and `count` control words.
- Interpret each captured control word as at least one clock sample: zero-coded period, width, or count values map to 1.
- Emit exactly `count` pulses. Each pulse is high for `width` clock samples, and pulse starts are separated by `period` clock samples.
- After the final pulse completes, drive `pulse` low and assert `done`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `clk`, `start`, `period0`, `period1`, `period2`, `period3`, `width0`, `width1`, `width2`, `width3`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `pulse`, `done`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
