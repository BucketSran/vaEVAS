# Sample Hold 5v Clock Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `sample_hold_5v_clock.va`:
  - Module `sample_hold_5v_clock` (entry)
    - position 0: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vout` (output, electrical)
    - position 2: `vclk` (input, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `sample_hold_5v_clock.vtrans_clk` defaults to `2.5`; valid range: finite; overrides vtrans_clk.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_DETECT_RISING_CROSSINGS_OF_VCLK_THROUGH`: restore: Detect rising crossings of `vclk` through `vtrans_clk`. At each qualifying edge, sample the instantaneous value of `vin` and hold that sampled value on `vout` until the next rising clock edge. Falling clock edges must not update the held value. Required traces: `time`, `vclk`, `vin`, `vout`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Detect rising crossings of `vclk` through `vtrans_clk`. At each qualifying edge, sample the instantaneous value of `vin` and hold that sampled value on `vout` until the next rising clock edge. Falling clock edges must not update the held value.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `sample_hold_5v_clock.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
