# Loop Filter Abstraction Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Loop Filter Abstraction` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `loop_filter_abstraction.va`:
  - Module `loop_filter_abstraction` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `out` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `metric` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/loop_filter_abstraction.va`
- DUT instance: `XFB_DUT (clk rst vin out metric) loop_filter_abstraction`
- Required saved public traces: `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `out`, `metric`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `loop_filter_abstraction.tr` defaults to `1e-10` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets rise and fall smoothing for out and metric.
- `loop_filter_abstraction.deadband` defaults to `0.05` V; valid range: deadband >= 0; sets the sampled error magnitude below which proportional and integral state hold.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_RESET_STATE`: exercise and make observable: Active reset restores the proportional state to 0.45 V, the step to 0.20 V, the integral residual and accepted-update count to zero, and metric to 0 V. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_DEADBAND_HOLD`: exercise and make observable: At a rising clk crossing, an error vin - 0.45 V whose magnitude does not exceed deadband produces no proportional, integral, step, or count update. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `out`, `metric`.
- `P_SIGNED_UPDATE`: exercise and make observable: Each accepted positive error increases the proportional state by the current step and each accepted negative error decreases it, while the integral residual accumulates 0.04 times the sampled error. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `vin`, `out`.
- `P_STEP_HALVING`: exercise and make observable: The proportional step halves after every accepted update, producing successively smaller proportional corrections for equal-sign errors. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `vin`, `out`.
- `P_LOCK_COUNT_METRIC`: exercise and make observable: Metric remains low for fewer than four accepted updates and is 0.9 V once the accepted-update count reaches four; reset clears it. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `metric`.
- `P_PROPORTIONAL_CLAMP`: exercise and make observable: The proportional state is clamped to 0.05 V through 0.85 V before the accumulated integral residual is added to form out. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `vin`, `out`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

The supplied DUT is a sampled/event-driven PLL loop-filter abstraction that approximates proportional and integral loop-control trends without modeling a transistor-level or KCL/KVL RC network.

- Treat `clk` and `rst` as voltage-coded logic with a 0.45 V threshold.
- Interpret `vin` as a signed loop-error stimulus around 0.45 V.
- Initialize and reset the proportional state to `0.45 V`, the proportional step to `0.20 V`, the integral residual to `0`, the accepted-update count to `0`, and `metric` to `0 V`.
- On each rising `clk` crossing, compute `err = V(vin) - 0.45`.
- When reset is low and `abs(err) > deadband`, accept an update: increase the proportional state by the current step for positive `err`, decrease it by the current step for negative `err`, then accumulate `integral += 0.04 * err`.
- After each accepted update, halve the step and increment the accepted-update count.
- Clamp the proportional state to `[0.05 V, 0.85 V]`.
- Drive `out` from the proportional state plus the accumulated integral residual.
- Drive `metric` to `0.9 V` once the accepted-update count reaches `4`, otherwise keep it at `0 V`. Reset clears the count and metric.


The required trace names are: `time`, `clk`, `rst`, `vin`, `out`, `metric`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
