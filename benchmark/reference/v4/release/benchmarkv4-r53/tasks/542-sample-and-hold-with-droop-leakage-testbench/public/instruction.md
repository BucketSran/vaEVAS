# Sample And Hold With Droop Leakage Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Sample And Hold With Droop Leakage` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `leaky_hold.va`:
  - Module `leaky_hold` (entry)
    - position 0: `sample` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `vout` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/leaky_hold.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (sample rst vin vout) leaky_hold`
- Required saved public traces: `sample`, `rst`, `vin`, `vout`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `leaky_hold.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: vth > 0; sets sample and rst voltage-coded logic threshold.
- `leaky_hold.decay` defaults to `0.985`; valid range: 0 < decay <= 1; sets the multiplicative held-value retention factor per leakage update.
- `leaky_hold.leak_period` defaults to `1e-09` s; valid range: leak_period > 0; sets the periodic leakage update interval.
- `leaky_hold.tr` defaults to `5e-10` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets vout transition smoothing.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_SAMPLE_CAPTURE`: exercise and make observable: Each rising sample crossing while reset is inactive captures the instantaneous vin voltage into the held state. Required traces: `time`, `sample`, `rst`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_HOLD_BETWEEN_EVENTS`: exercise and make observable: Between sample and leakage events, vout reflects the retained held state rather than continuously tracking vin. Required traces: `time`, `sample`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_PERIODIC_DROOP`: exercise and make observable: At every leak_period update while reset is inactive, the held value is multiplied by decay. Required traces: `time`, `rst`, `vout`.
- `P_RESET_CLEAR`: exercise and make observable: Active reset clears the held state to 0 V at sampling or leakage update events. Required traces: `time`, `sample`, `rst`, `vout`.
- `P_SMOOTH_OUTPUT`: exercise and make observable: Vout approaches each held-state target with the finite transition smoothing set by tr. Required traces: `time`, `vout`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- On each rising `sample` crossing while reset is low, capture the current
  `vin` voltage into the held state.
- While reset is low, apply leakage by periodically multiplying the held state
  by `decay`.
- While reset is high, clear the held state to zero.
- Drive `vout` from the held state with smooth voltage-domain transitions.


The required trace names are: `time`, `sample`, `rst`, `vin`, `vout`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
