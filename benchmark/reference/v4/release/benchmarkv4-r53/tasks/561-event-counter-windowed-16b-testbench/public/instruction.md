# Event Counter Windowed 16b Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Event Counter Windowed 16b` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `event_counter_windowed_16b.va`:
  - Module `event_counter_windowed_16b` (entry)
    - position 0: `gate` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `event_in` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `done` (output, electrical)
    - position 3: `count0` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `count1` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `count2` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `count3` (output, electrical)
    - position 7: `count4` (output, electrical)
    - position 8: `count5` (output, electrical)
    - position 9: `count6` (output, electrical)
    - position 10: `count7` (output, electrical)
    - position 11: `count8` (output, electrical)
    - position 12: `count9` (output, electrical)
    - position 13: `count10` (output, electrical)
    - position 14: `count11` (output, electrical)
    - position 15: `count12` (output, electrical)
    - position 16: `count13` (output, electrical)
    - position 17: `count14` (output, electrical)
    - position 18: `count15` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/event_counter_windowed_16b.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (gate event done count0 count1 count2 count3 count4 count5 count6 count7 count8 count9 count10 count11 count12 count13 count14 count15) event_counter_windowed_16b`
- Required saved public traces: `gate`, `event`, `done`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `event_counter_windowed_16b.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vdd > 0; sets the voltage-coded count and done high level.
- `event_counter_windowed_16b.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: 0 < vth < vdd; sets the gate and event edge threshold.
- `event_counter_windowed_16b.tr` defaults to `2e-11` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets output transition smoothing.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_WINDOW_OPEN`: exercise and make observable: A rising gate crossing clears the count, opens a new measurement window, and drives done low. Required traces: `time`, `gate`, `event`, `done`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`.
- `P_IN_WINDOW_COUNT`: exercise and make observable: Each rising event crossing increments the count exactly once only while the window is active and gate is high. Required traces: `time`, `gate`, `event`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`.
- `P_OUT_OF_WINDOW_IGNORE`: exercise and make observable: Event crossings before a window opens or after it closes do not change the held result. Required traces: `time`, `gate`, `event`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`.
- `P_WINDOW_CLOSE_HOLD`: exercise and make observable: A falling gate crossing closes the window, preserves the final count, and asserts done. Required traces: `time`, `gate`, `event`, `done`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`.
- `P_BIT_ORDER_AND_LEVELS`: exercise and make observable: count0 is the least significant bit and count15 is the most significant bit; asserted outputs use vdd and inactive outputs use 0 V. Required traces: `time`, `done`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- On a rising `gate` crossing, clear the counter, mark the window active, and drive `done` low.
- Count rising `event_in` crossings only while the window is active and `gate` is high.
- On a falling `gate` crossing, close the window, hold the count, and assert `done`.
- Drive `count0` as the least significant bit through `count15` as the most significant bit.


The required trace names are: `time`, `gate`, `event`, `done`, `count0`, `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`, `count5`, `count6`, `count7`, `count8`, `count9`, `count10`, `count11`, `count12`, `count13`, `count14`, `count15`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
