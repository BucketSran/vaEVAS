# ADC Zoom Timing Sequencer Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `ADC Zoom Timing Sequencer` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `adc_zoom_timing_sequencer.va`:
  - Module `adc_zoom_timing_sequencer` (entry)
    - position 0: `rst` (output, electrical)
    - position 1: `s` (output, electrical)
    - position 2: `sar` (output, electrical)
    - position 3: `res` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `intg` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `clk_sar` (output, electrical)
    - position 6: `zoom` (output, electrical)
    - position 7: `clk_zoom` (output, electrical)
    - position 8: `rst_zoom` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/adc_zoom_timing_sequencer.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (rst s sar res intg clk_sar zoom clk_zoom rst_zoom) adc_zoom_timing_sequencer`
- Required saved public traces: `clk_sar`, `clk_zoom`, `intg`, `res`, `rst`, `rst_zoom`, `s`, `sar`, `zoom`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- No public parameter is declared.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_GENERATE_A_REPEATING_32_NS_COMPACT`: exercise and make observable: Generate a repeating 32 ns compact ADC timing frame with these high windows: `rst` from 0.5 to 0.8 ns; `s` from 1.5 to 2.5 ns; `sar` from 3.0 to 5.4 ns; `clk_sar` from 3.0 to 3.25 ns, 3.6 to 3.85 ns, and 4.2 to 4.45 ns; `res` from 6.0 to 6.6 ns; `intg` from 8.0 to 8.7 ns; `zoom` from 9.2 to 10.8 ns; `clk_zoom` from 9.2 to 9.45 ns and 9.8 to 10.05 ns; and `rst_zoom` from 11.0 to 11.5 ns. All outputs should return low between their public windows and repeat every 32 ns. Required traces: `time`, `clk_sar`, `clk_zoom`, `intg`, `res`, `rst`, `rst_zoom`, `s`, `sar`, `zoom`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Generate a repeating 32 ns compact ADC timing frame with these high windows: `rst` from 0.5 to 0.8 ns; `s` from 1.5 to 2.5 ns; `sar` from 3.0 to 5.4 ns; `clk_sar` from 3.0 to 3.25 ns, 3.6 to 3.85 ns, and 4.2 to 4.45 ns; `res` from 6.0 to 6.6 ns; `intg` from 8.0 to 8.7 ns; `zoom` from 9.2 to 10.8 ns; `clk_zoom` from 9.2 to 9.45 ns and 9.8 to 10.05 ns; and `rst_zoom` from 11.0 to 11.5 ns. All outputs should return low between their public windows and repeat every 32 ns.


The required trace names are: `time`, `clk_sar`, `clk_zoom`, `intg`, `res`, `rst`, `rst_zoom`, `s`, `sar`, `zoom`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
