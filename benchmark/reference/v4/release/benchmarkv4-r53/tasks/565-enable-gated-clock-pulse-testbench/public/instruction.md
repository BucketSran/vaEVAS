# Enable Gated Clock Pulse Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Enable Gated Clock Pulse` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `enable_gated_clock_pulse.va`:
  - Module `enable_gated_clock_pulse` (entry)
    - position 0: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `en` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `pulse` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/enable_gated_clock_pulse.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (clk en pulse) enable_gated_clock_pulse`
- Required saved public traces: `clk`, `en`, `pulse`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `enable_gated_clock_pulse.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: vdd > 0; sets the voltage-coded high level of pulse.
- `enable_gated_clock_pulse.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: 0 < vth < vdd; sets the logic decision threshold for clk and en.
- `enable_gated_clock_pulse.tr` defaults to `2e-11` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets the rise and fall smoothing time of pulse.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_ENABLED_HIGH`: exercise and make observable: pulse approaches vdd whenever both clk and en are above vth. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.
- `P_DISABLED_LOW`: exercise and make observable: pulse approaches 0 V whenever either clk or en is below vth. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.
- `P_ENABLE_GATING`: exercise and make observable: Changing en gates the observed clock level without creating a high output while clk is logically low. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.
- `P_OUTPUT_LEVELS`: exercise and make observable: pulse uses voltage-coded 0 V and vdd levels with finite transition smoothing set by tr. Required traces: `time`, `pulse`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- Treat `clk` and `en` as voltage-coded logic using `vth`.
- Drive `pulse` high exactly when both `clk` and `en` are high.
- Drive `pulse` low otherwise.


The required trace names are: `time`, `clk`, `en`, `pulse`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
