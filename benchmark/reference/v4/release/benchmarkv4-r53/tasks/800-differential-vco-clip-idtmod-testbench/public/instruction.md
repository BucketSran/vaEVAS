# Differential VCO With Clip And Idtmod Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Differential VCO With Clip And Idtmod` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.va`:
  - Module `differential_vco_clip_idtmod` (entry)
    - position 0: `vinp` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vinm` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `outp` (output, electrical)
    - position 3: `outm` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `metric` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/differential_vco_clip_idtmod.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (vinp vinm outp outm metric) differential_vco_clip_idtmod`
- Required saved public traces: `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.Fnom` defaults to `20.0e6 from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides Fnom.
- `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.dFdV` defaults to `160.0e6 exclude 0.0`; valid range: finite; overrides dFdV.
- `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.Fmin` defaults to `5.0e6 from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides Fmin.
- `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.Fmax` defaults to `80.0e6 from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides Fmax.
- `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.Vcm` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides Vcm.
- `differential_vco_clip_idtmod.Vac` defaults to `0.4 from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides Vac.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_FREQ_Q_CLIP_FNOM_DFDV_V`: exercise and make observable: `freq_q = `clip(Fnom + dFdV * V(vinp, vinm), Fmin, Fmax)` Required traces: `time`, `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`.
- `P_PHASE_Q_IDTMOD_FREQ_Q_0`: exercise and make observable: `phase_q = idtmod(freq_q, 0.0, 1.0)` (modulo-1 phase accumulator) Required traces: `time`, `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`.
- `P_OUTP_VCM_VAC_SIN_M_TWO`: exercise and make observable: `outp = Vcm + Vac * sin(M_TWO_PI * phase_q)` (positive differential arm) Required traces: `time`, `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`.
- `P_OUTM_VCM_VAC_SIN_M_TWO`: exercise and make observable: `outm = Vcm - Vac * sin(M_TWO_PI * phase_q)` (negative differential arm) Required traces: `time`, `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`.
- `P_METRIC_0_9_PHASE_Q_VOLTAGE`: exercise and make observable: `metric = 0.9 * phase_q` (voltage-coded instantaneous wrapped phase, `0 V` to `0.9 V`) Required traces: `time`, `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Use `idtmod()` as a voltage-domain phase integrator whose instantaneous
frequency is set by the differential control voltage `V(vinp, vinm)`, clamp the
frequency into a legal band with a `clip` macro, and produce a fully
differential sine output.

This is a behavioral continuous-time task, not a conservative-current/KCL task.
Do not use `I(...)`, `ddt(...)`, or `idt(...)`.

The observable instantaneous frequency must equal `Fnom + dFdV * V(vinp,
vinm)` while that value lies inside `[Fmin, Fmax]`, and must remain at the
corresponding endpoint outside that band. Integrate this frequency with a
modulo-one `idtmod()` phase accumulator.

Drive `outp` and `outm` as equal-amplitude, opposite-polarity sine arms around
`Vcm`. Their common mode must remain at `Vcm`, each arm must have amplitude
`Vac`, and a rising zero crossing must recur at the clipped frequency. Expose
the wrapped phase as `metric`, linearly mapping phase zero to `0 V` and the
upper end of the modulo-one interval to `0.9 V`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `vinp`, `vinm`, `outp`, `outm`, `metric`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
