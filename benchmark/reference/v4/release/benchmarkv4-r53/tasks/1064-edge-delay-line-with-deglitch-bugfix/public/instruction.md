# Edge Delay Line with Deglitch Window Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `edge_delay_line_deglitch.va`:
  - Module `edge_delay_line_deglitch` (entry)
    - position 0: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `rst` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `enable` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `vout` (output, electrical)
    - position 4: `edge_valid` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `rejected` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.vdd` defaults to `0.9` V; valid range: finite real greater than vss; sets the logic-high target for vout, edge_valid, and rejected.
- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.vss` defaults to `0.0` V; valid range: finite real less than vdd; sets the cleared and logic-low target for all public outputs.
- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: vss < vth < vdd; sets the decision threshold for vin, rst, and enable.
- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.tick` defaults to `2.5e-10` s; valid range: tick > 0; sets the deterministic qualification and delay scheduling interval.
- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.delay_ticks` defaults to `4` ticks; valid range: 0 <= delay_ticks <= 200; sets the additional number of scheduling ticks between qualification and output emission.
- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.min_width_ticks` defaults to `3` ticks; valid range: 1 <= min_width_ticks <= 200; sets the number of stable scheduling ticks required to qualify an input edge.
- `edge_delay_line_deglitch.tr` defaults to `1e-10` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets rise and fall smoothing for all public voltage outputs.

Scored evaluation uses the published default parameter values; alternative parameter overrides are outside the scored behavior contract.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_RESET_DISABLE_CLEAR`: restore: When rst is above vth or enable is at or below vth, pending edge state is cancelled and vout, edge_valid, and rejected settle to vss no later than the next scheduling tick. Required traces: `time`, `rst`, `enable`, `vout`, `edge_valid`, `rejected`.
- `P_STABLE_EDGE_QUALIFICATION`: restore: A rising or falling vin crossing through vth can qualify only when vin remains in the crossed-to logic state for min_width_ticks scheduling ticks while reset is inactive and the DUT is enabled. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `rst`, `enable`, `vout`.
- `P_DELAYED_EDGE_EMISSION`: restore: After an input edge qualifies, vout changes to the corresponding vdd or vss target only after the additional delay_ticks scheduling interval and does not change early. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`.
- `P_NARROW_GLITCH_REJECTION`: restore: If vin reverses before a pending edge completes qualification, that edge does not update vout and rejected produces a bounded high pulse. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`, `rejected`.
- `P_VALID_EMISSION_PULSE`: restore: Each qualified delayed update of vout produces one bounded high pulse on edge_valid, while rejected remains reserved for cancelled narrow edges. Required traces: `time`, `vout`, `edge_valid`, `rejected`.
- `P_BIDIRECTIONAL_LEVELS`: restore: Qualified rising and falling input edges can respectively drive vout toward vdd and vss, and all public outputs use tr-smoothed voltage transitions. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `vout`, `edge_valid`, `rejected`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- Reset or a low `enable` clears the delayed output and all pending edge state.
- An input edge must remain stable for `min_width_ticks` timer ticks before it can be emitted.
- A qualified edge updates `vout` after an additional `delay_ticks` timer ticks.
- A pending edge that reverses before qualification is rejected and must not update `vout`.
- `edge_valid` pulses when a qualified delayed edge updates the output.
- `rejected` pulses when a narrow glitch is rejected.


## Modeling Constraints

- AMS role: qualified edge-delay and deglitch block for mixed-signal clock, timing, and control paths.
- Use deterministic voltage-domain threshold events and periodic scheduling state for qualification and delayed emission.
- Use voltage contributions for vout, edge_valid, and rejected, with transition smoothing controlled by tr.
- Preserve the positional six-port interface and all declared public parameter names and defaults; scored evaluation uses the published default values.
- Do not use current contributions, transistor-level devices, random sources, external table files, AC/noise behavior, debug outputs, validation hooks, or simulator-specific side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `edge_delay_line_deglitch.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
