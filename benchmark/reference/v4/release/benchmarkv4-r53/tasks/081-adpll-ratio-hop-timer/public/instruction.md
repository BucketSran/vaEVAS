## Required Behavior

This task asks for the `adpll_ratio_hop_ref` behavioral module, not a Spectre
testbench. The module models an ADPLL timing loop that locks to a reference,
responds to a commanded divider-ratio hop, and reacquires lock after the hop.

Required observable behavior:

- Use `ref_clk` as the reference timing input.
- Interpret `ratio_ctrl` as a voltage-coded requested feedback divide ratio in
  volts: round `V(ratio_ctrl)` to the nearest integer with half-step boundaries,
  with an exact positive half-step rounding upward to the next integer, then
  clip the requested ratio to the inclusive `ratio_min` through `ratio_max`
  range. Legal overrides of `ratio_min` and `ratio_max` must define the active
  saturation endpoints rather than limiting the encoding to the default
  2-through-16 range.
- Generate a behavioral DCO clock on `vout`.
- Generate `fb_clk` by dividing the DCO activity according to the requested
  ratio.
- Adjust a bounded internal control code from reference/feedback timing error
  rather than driving `fb_clk` from an independent source.
- Drive `vctrl_mon` as a rail-referenced monitor of the bounded loop-control
  state.
- Assert `lock` after stable pre-hop tracking, deassert or lose qualification
  during a ratio hop, and assert again after reacquisition.
- Keep generated frequencies within `f_min` and `f_max`; use appropriate
  timestep guidance such as `$bound_step` for oscillator timing.

Use voltage-coded logic with a mid-supply decision threshold where applicable,
drive high logic outputs near `VDD` and low outputs near `VSS`, and keep the
model pure behavioral Verilog-A. Do not use transistor-level devices, AC/noise
analysis, validation logic, validation-only hooks, or simulator-specific side
channels.

## Modeling Constraints

Use deterministic Verilog-A behavioral modeling appropriate for the public circuit contract. Do not hard-code validation stimulus tables, transient stop times, or sample windows into the DUT unless that behavior is part of the public circuit contract.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one source artifact named `adpll_ratio_hop_ref.va`. Companion
support files are supplied by the verification harness for this task.
