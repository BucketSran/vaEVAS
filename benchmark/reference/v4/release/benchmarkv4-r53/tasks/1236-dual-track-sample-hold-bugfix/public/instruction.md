# Dual Track Sample Hold Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve this exact artifact and module interface:

- Artifact `dual_track_sample_hold.va`:
  - Module `dual_track_sample_hold` (entry)
    - position 0: `vdd` (inout, electrical)
    - position 1: `vss` (inout, electrical)
    - position 2: `clk` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `vout` (output, electrical)
    - position 5: `phase` (output, electrical)

## Public Parameter Contract

- `dual_track_sample_hold.vth` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vth.
- `dual_track_sample_hold.tick` defaults to `0.5n from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides tick.
- `dual_track_sample_hold.alpha_in` defaults to `0.45 from (0:1]`; valid range: finite; overrides alpha_in.
- `dual_track_sample_hold.alpha_out` defaults to `0.55 from (0:1]`; valid range: finite; overrides alpha_out.
- `dual_track_sample_hold.tedge` defaults to `50p from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides tedge.
- `dual_track_sample_hold.vinit` defaults to `0.0`; valid range: finite; overrides vinit.


## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_COMPLEMENTARY_TRACK_HOLD_SEQUENCE`: restore: During low clock phase the input stage tracks `vin` while output holds; after the rising edge, the output stage tracks the retained input-stage value during high clock phase; after the falling edge, output holds until the next high phase. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `phase`, `vin`, `vout`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_FINITE_TRACKING_AND_HOLD`: restore: Use finite acquisition updates and preserve held values between tracking windows rather than making the output continuously transparent or a single ideal edge sample. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `phase`, `vin`, `vout`, `vdd`, `vss`.
- `P_PHASE_MONITOR_POLARITY`: restore: Drive `phase` high only during output-stage tracking and low otherwise. Required traces: `time`, `clk`, `phase`, `vin`, `vout`, `vdd`, `vss`.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

During low clock phase, the input stage tracks `vin` with finite acquisition while the output stage holds. On the rising clock transition, the input stage retains its acquired value. During high clock phase, the output stage tracks that retained input-stage value with finite bandwidth. On falling clock transition, the output stage holds until the next high phase. Clamp internal stored voltages to the local rail span and drive `phase` high only during output-stage tracking.


## Modeling Constraints

- Use deterministic voltage-domain behavioral Verilog-A.
- Do not hard-code validation stimulus, stop times, sample windows, gold internals, or simulator side channels.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these paths: `dual_track_sample_hold.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
