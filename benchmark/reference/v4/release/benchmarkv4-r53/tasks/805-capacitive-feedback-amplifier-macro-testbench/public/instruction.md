# Capacitive-feedback Amplifier Macro Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `Capacitive-feedback Amplifier Macro` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.va`:
  - Module `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro` (entry)
    - position 0: `vin` (inout, electrical)
    - position 1: `clk` (inout, electrical)
    - position 2: `rst` (inout, electrical)
    - position 3: `enable` (inout, electrical)
    - position 4: `gain_1` (inout, electrical)
    - position 5: `gain_0` (inout, electrical)
    - position 6: `vout` (inout, electrical)
    - position 7: `sampled_metric` (inout, electrical)
    - position 8: `settled` (inout, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (vin clk rst enable gain_1 gain_0 vout sampled_metric settled) capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro`
- Required saved public traces: `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.vdd` defaults to `0.9`; valid range: finite; overrides vdd.
- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.vss` defaults to `0.0`; valid range: finite; overrides vss.
- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.vcm` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vcm.
- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.vth` defaults to `0.45`; valid range: finite; overrides vth.
- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.tr` defaults to `200p from (0:inf)`; valid range: finite; overrides tr.
- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.gain_step` defaults to `0.75`; valid range: finite; overrides gain_step.
- `capacitive_feedback_amplifier_macro.settle_tol` defaults to `10e-3`; valid range: finite; overrides settle_tol.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_ON_RESET_OR_WHEN_DISABLED_DRIVE`: exercise and make observable: On reset or when disabled, drive `vout` to `vcm`, clear `sampled_metric`, and clear `settled`. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.
- `P_ON_EACH_RISING_CLK_EDGE_WHILE`: exercise and make observable: On each rising `clk` edge while enabled, sample `vin` and decode `gain_1..gain_0` as a programmable capacitor ratio. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.
- `P_DRIVE_SAMPLED_METRIC_WITH_THE_HELD`: exercise and make observable: Drive `sampled_metric` with the held input sample. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.
- `P_MOVE_VOUT_TOWARD_VCM_GAIN_SAMPLE`: exercise and make observable: Decode `code = (gain_0 > vth ? 1 : 0) + 2*(gain_1 > vth ? 1 : 0)` and `gain = 1.0 + gain_step*code`; on each accepted edge drive `vout = clamp(vcm + gain*(sample - vcm), vss, vdd)` without an additional slew step. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.
- `P_ASSERT_SETTLED_AFTER_THE_OUTPUT_HAS`: exercise and make observable: Assert `settled` after the output has stayed within `settle_tol` of the target for two enabled updates. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.
- `P_USE_ONLY_VOLTAGE_DOMAIN_BEHAVIORAL_STATE`: exercise and make observable: Use only voltage-domain behavioral state and voltage contributions on public electrical outputs. Required traces: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

- On reset or when disabled, drive `vout` to `vcm`, clear `sampled_metric`, and clear `settled`.
- On each rising `clk` edge while enabled, sample `vin` and decode `gain_1..gain_0` as a programmable capacitor ratio.
- Drive `sampled_metric` with the held input sample.
- Move `vout` toward `vcm + gain * (sample - vcm)` with bounded per-update movement.
- Assert `settled` after the output has stayed within `settle_tol` of the target for two enabled updates.
- Use only voltage-domain behavioral state and voltage contributions on public electrical outputs.
- Do not expose pass/fail flags; expose only the public observable metrics named in the interface.

The exact gain contract is `code = (gain_0 > vth ? 1 : 0) + 2*(gain_1 > vth ? 1 : 0)`, `gain = 1.0 + gain_step*code`, and, on each accepted edge, `vout = clamp(vcm + gain*(sample - vcm), vss, vdd)`. Do not apply an additional slew step.


The required trace names are: `time`, `vin`, `clk`, `rst`, `enable`, `gain_1`, `gain_0`, `vout`, `sampled_metric`, `settled`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
