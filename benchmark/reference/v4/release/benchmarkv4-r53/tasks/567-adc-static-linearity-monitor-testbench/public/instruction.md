# ADC Static Linearity Monitor Testbench

## Task Contract

Write one top-level Spectre testbench that verifies the public contract of the
supplied read-only `ADC Static Linearity Monitor` DUT. The evaluator runs the same submitted bytes
against the correct DUT and five anonymous semantic negative DUTs. Your
testbench must accept the correct DUT and expose all five behavioral faults.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

- Artifact `adc_static_linearity_monitor.va`:
  - Module `adc_static_linearity_monitor` (entry)
    - position 0: `vsample` (input, electrical)
    - position 1: `vin` (input, electrical)
    - position 2: `d2` (input, electrical)
    - position 3: `d1` (input, electrical)
    - position 4: `d0` (input, electrical)
    - position 5: `maxerr` (output, electrical)

Stable public Spectre binding:

The submitted `testbench.scs` must use the supplied DUT through this public binding:

- Include path: `./dut/adc_static_linearity_monitor.va`
- DUT instance: `XDUT (vsample vin d2 d1 d0 maxerr) adc_static_linearity_monitor`
- Required saved public traces: `vsample`, `vin`, `d2`, `d1`, `d0`, `maxerr`
- Use one bounded transient analysis with a finite positive stop time.

You must design the stimulus yourself. Save traces as bare public signal names
(for example `clk`, not suffixed or hierarchical forms such as `clk:V` or
`XDUT.clk`). Do not redefine the DUT, drive DUT output nets, save
hierarchical/private nodes, or use checker/gold/internal files.

## Public Parameter Contract

- `adc_static_linearity_monitor.vref` defaults to `1.0` V; valid range: vref > 0; sets the full-scale range used to derive the ideal three-bit bin-floor code.
- `adc_static_linearity_monitor.vth` defaults to `0.45` V; valid range: vth > 0; sets the threshold for vsample and observed output-bit decoding.
- `adc_static_linearity_monitor.lsb_out` defaults to `1.0` V/code; valid range: lsb_out > 0; scales each retained code-error LSB into the maxerr output voltage.
- `adc_static_linearity_monitor.tr` defaults to `2e-11` s; valid range: tr > 0; sets maxerr output transition smoothing.


## Required Behavior

Create stimulus and save traces sufficient for the fixed evaluator oracle to check:

- `P_STROBE_UPDATE`: exercise and make observable: The retained error metric updates only on rising crossings of vsample through vth and holds between strobes. Required traces: `time`, `vsample`, `vin`, `d2`, `d1`, `d0`, `maxerr`.
- `P_IDEAL_CODE`: exercise and make observable: At a strobe, vin is clipped to 0 through vref and mapped to the ideal three-bit bin-floor code. Required traces: `time`, `vsample`, `vin`, `maxerr`.
- `P_OBSERVED_CODE`: exercise and make observable: At a strobe, d2 through d0 are threshold-decoded as an unsigned three-bit word with d2 as MSB and d0 as LSB. Required traces: `time`, `vsample`, `d2`, `d1`, `d0`, `maxerr`.
- `P_ABSOLUTE_ERROR`: exercise and make observable: Each sampled error is the absolute difference in codes between the ideal and observed three-bit words. Required traces: `time`, `vsample`, `vin`, `d2`, `d1`, `d0`, `maxerr`.
- `P_MAX_RETENTION`: exercise and make observable: maxerr never decreases during a run and represents the largest sampled absolute code error seen so far. Required traces: `time`, `vsample`, `maxerr`.
- `P_METRIC_SCALE`: exercise and make observable: maxerr equals the retained maximum code error multiplied by lsb_out, with smoothing set by tr. Required traces: `time`, `maxerr`.

Use any deterministic stimulus layout that makes every required public behavior
observable. Exact event counts, absolute event times, sample density, and
reference-deck ordering are not part of the contract unless stated explicitly
above.


The following canonical public behavior is normative for this derived form:

Act as a sampled static-linearity measurement monitor for a three-bit ADC sweep.
On each rising crossing of `vsample` through `vth`, clip `vin` to the
0-to-`vref` range and compute the ideal bin-floor three-bit code. Decode the
observed `d2..d0` word using `vth`, compute the absolute code error in LSBs, and
retain the maximum sampled error seen so far during the run. Drive `maxerr` to
that retained maximum multiplied by `lsb_out`.


The required trace names are: `time`, `vsample`, `vin`, `d2`, `d1`, `d0`, `maxerr`.

## Modeling Constraints

- Submit one self-contained top-level transient `.scs` file.
- Use only the declared `./dut/...` source paths and public DUT interfaces.
- Do not redefine the DUT, drive declared DUT outputs, inspect private internals,
  access undeclared files, or emit a self-reported result.
- Missing traces, setup errors, and invalid runs do not count as behavioral kills.

## Output Contract

Return exactly one artifact named `testbench.scs`. Do not return a DUT,
checker, script, data file, waveform, or auxiliary deck.
